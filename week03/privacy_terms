Doe Grades vs Google Classroom 

Doe Grades: 
A secure and integrated tool for assignment-level grading . It automatically imports rosters and course information from STARS. Doe Grades creates assignments and pulls existing assignments from DOE LMS . It also collects grades for each assignment. 
It is able to auto-calculate marking period grades based on customizable and policy-approved rules. Marking period grades can be sent to STARS with one click. 

Google Classroom:
When you upload a file of any type to Google Classroom, it is stored securely in our world-class data centers. Data is encrypted in-transit and at-rest. If you choose to access these files offline, we store this info on your device.Your Google Account comes with built-in security designed to detect and block threats like spam, phishing and malware. Your activity is stored using strong industry standards and practices.


When looking at Doe Grades it was created to maintain both student and teacher privacy when it comes to student grading. It bridges the gap between STARS and grading platforms used. Google classroom does similar actions as it collects the grades from the assignments submitted. Doe grades seems to  be the weaker of the two as it cannot upload documents and share to students the same way google classroom is able to. It seems like a good idea in theory with the DOE trying to centralized the services it provides to allow students and teachers and easier access to applications but without proper cyber security in place I believe that a data breach is still possible. Google tends to be more secure due to it being a large tech company but data breaches have occurred in Google. Doe grades will be able to improve by adopting more of google classroom practices making it a more centralized location eventually phasing out Google Classroom.
