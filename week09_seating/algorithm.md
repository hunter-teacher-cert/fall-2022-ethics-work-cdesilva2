Write up a description of the algorithm you will implement as a text, pdf or md file and store it in the folder under the name algorithm.txt, algorithm.pdf or algorithm.md

When trying to design the most ethical algorithm for this problem it really came down to separating families and loved ones. Friends are more willing to sit away from each other but it is often imperative that families especially with small children stay together. Currently it seems to be the form where you pay an extra fee and you can book seats together. I do beleive that if all the seats are not filled flyers should not be charged to sit together but if seats are filled then a fee should be charged to make this upgraded accomdations.
